# UHJdecoder
UHJ decoder for E4L

This decoder uses the Gerzon's formula for the UHJ stereo decoding[1].  
  
It is stereo compatible in that, without decoding, the listener perceives a stereo image, but one that is significantly wider than conventional stereo. The left and right channels can also be summed for a very high degree of mono-compatibility[2].  
It covers the entire horizontal plane: "...The front-stage material is reproduced with sharply defined images occupying virtually the whole of the stereo stage, and that some sound positions can appear marginally beyond the loudspeakers. Rear-stage sounds appear with rather less well-defined images between the stereo loudspeaker"[3].
